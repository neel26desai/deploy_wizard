3. Actions taken:

LLM generates deployment.yaml and service.yaml

Saves YAMLs into the specified folder

Applies them automatically with kubectl

Creates Deployment and Service inside Kubernetes

4. Verify the Deployment
```
kubectl get pods
```
5.Check services:
```
kubectl get services
```
6. Access the Application
```
minikube service your-service-name --url
```


âš¡ Notes
Make sure Minikube cluster is running before deploying.

Make sure Docker images you want to deploy are publicly accessible.

The wizard fully automates YAML generation and application â€” no manual Kubernetes files needed.
